I started doing the pandas exercises today, but pycharm for some reason won't render jupyter notebooks, so I'm doing the exercises from github.
I've looked at the exercises, but I wasn't able to do any of them, so I had to look at the solutions.
Tomorrow, I'll look over the pandas documentation while I do the exercises.

I've also started on trying to make a non-jekyll website using React, but I haven't gotten very far. I've only installed it and created a simple webpage as of now.
