This is my first post!
I just got my blog set up, and will start working on the pandas exercises soon.
One thing I want to do, though, is to make this blog without jekyll, because the format doesn't allow for any easy navigation.
That'll be done sometime in the far future; I forgot most, if not all, of my knowledge on web development.
For now, I'll just start learning pandas and other python libraries.
