Today Fisher introduced the Energize Andover shared drive. On it were some documents with  weekly meetings, plans, and members. We went over the plans for a curriculum for new members.
We also discussed how the club should operate from now on, and how new members should be accepted. We discussed some challenges with being able to accomodate new members, and how the club should be organized to fit newer members.
We decided not to accept people through the club fair, as the amount of new members that we could get might be too much to handle. Instead, we will likely accept people through AP Java and AP CS classes.

Since next week is winter break, we will have a lot of time to work on projects. However, I don't have any projects I'm working on.
