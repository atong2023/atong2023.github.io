Today Fisher went over the assignment from last time. We also found out some interesting things, such as what happens when a module and package have the same name on the same level.

Things I learned:
- How packages and modules work/the difference
- \_\_init\_\_ in packages
- How to use modules that are part of imported packages
- The purposes of different files in the default poetry project
- Some markdown syntax to make this list
