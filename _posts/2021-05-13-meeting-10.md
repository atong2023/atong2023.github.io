Today we went over assignment 3, which I had a few problems with importing on. It turns out that relative imports are very hard to use, and that the root directory cannot be a package. After debugging my code with Fisher a lot and having a lot of random errors, we got everything to work.

Things I learned today:
-The root directory cannot be a package
-Using python3 without -m doesn't work with imports while python3 -m does
-You should only be able to run python3 from the root directory
-Context managers
-Imports cannot contain multiple levels
-touch makes empty files
