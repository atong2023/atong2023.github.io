Today we went over the first pandas exercise. Fisher also shared a document detailing how connect to the server and use poetry and pandas. 

I tried to get a non-cookie cutter jekyll blog running, but there were a lot of technical issues. After some debugging with Fisher, we were able to find out that the problem was in the _config.yml file. I deleted some lines in it, and it magically worked. However, it only works with the minima theme.
